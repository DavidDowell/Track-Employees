# Track-Employees

## Application Objective

Create a content management system to allow a business owner to interact with stored database information.

## How It Works

* Inquirer is installed and used for prompts in the command line.
* Application starts when the user types "node index.js" into the command line.
* Options show up that the user can choose including: view all departments, view all roles, view all employees, add a role, add an employee, and update.
* View all deparments brings up a table with the department names and ids.
* View all rolls provides information on each role including job title, role id, department, and salary for that role.
* View all employees presents a formatted table showing employee data, including employee ids, first names, last names, job titles, departments, salaries,  and managers that the employees report to.
* Add a department prompts the user to type the name of whatever new department they plan to create.
* Add a role prompts the user to enter the name, salary, and department for the role and that role is added to the database.
* Update an employee role allows the user to change the current role of a current employee and updates the database.
